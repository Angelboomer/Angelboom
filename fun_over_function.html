    <h1>Fun over Function</h1>
    <p>
        Here is where I will go into the concept of
        'Fun over Function'. This has been a personal mantra <br> of mine but I believe
        it is a commonly thought idea which is utilized in fields from Game Design <br>
        to the Web Design. 
        Fun vs. function in UI design isn't a battle of opposites—it’s a reminder <br>
        that usefulness and emotional engagement can, and should, coexist.
        Interfaces that <br> are purely functional may communicate clearly, but they often fail <br> to connect with users
        on a human level. In areas like healthcare or education, where clarity
        is essential,<br> a simple, clean approach is necessary—but
        that doesn’t mean design has to be cold or clinical. <br>
        <br>
        As seen in projects like Help Remedies, UI that speaks to emotional needs <br>
        while remaining clear proves that adding personality can strengthen <br>
        trust and understanding. <br>
        <br>
        We tend to separate creativity into categories: one for serious, utilitarian design, and another
        for playful, artistic expression. <br> But when we bring joy, humor, or 
        empathy into functional design, it becomes more effective.
        People remember what makes them feel something—<br>whether it’s a smile,
        a sense of relief, or a moment of curiosity. As pointed out in the text by Lisa Matbly, 
        engaging design multiplies its usefulness. Especially in UI, <br>
        where interaction shapes experience, a thoughtful mix of clarity and character can <br>
        transform an ordinary interface into something meaningful and memorable.
